== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to configure demo import? =

Theme authors can configure the demo imports by hooking into the `sd/edi/importer/config` filter. A sample configuration can be found in the *plugin directory -> samples* folder along with a sample zip file.

= How can I see the demo importer in action? =

A sample configuration is provided in the *plugin directory -> samples* folder along with a sample zip file. It is configured to work with the default **Twenty Twenty-One** theme. You need to require the `sample-config.php` file in the theme to see the importer in action (it will even work in localhost).

= Where is the demo import page? =

If your theme is correctly configured, you can find the demo import page with all the demos in *Dashboard -> Appearance -> Easy Demo Importer*.

= How can I export plugin settings to configure with the demo import? =

Theme developers can use the [WP Options Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/options-importer) plugin to downloading the data from the options table. Then, use some preferable tools to decode and convert this data into a JSON format and include them in the demo zip file.

= I can't import demo. It is saying there are errors. What can I do? =

Commonly, errors encountered during the demo import process are often associated with the relatively smaller `max_execution_time` or server timeout settings. A practical first step is to inspect the built-in **Easy System Status** page, which can provide insights into any problematic server parameters. Once these issues are fixed, your demo import should work smoothly.
